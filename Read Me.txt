Please note that I have created a self-hosted agent on my Windows machine and added it to the default agent pool due to the 'No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted' error. I have requested a free parallelism grant from Azure, but it hasn't been granted yet. As running acceptance tests from Azure takes time, I have attached a video showing how the process of my ReadyAPI project runs in the Azure DevOps pipeline.
